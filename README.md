# Secret Number Game

A fun and interactive project developed as the final assignment for the Alura JavaScript programming course. The goal of the game is to guess the randomly generated secret number while receiving helpful hints.

## Features
- Utilizes the `Math` library to generate random secret numbers.
- Ensures that the generated secret numbers do not repeat.
- Provides hints to the player, indicating whether the entered number is greater or lower than the secret number.


## How to Play
